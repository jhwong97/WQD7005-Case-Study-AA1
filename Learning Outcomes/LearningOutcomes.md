By conducting this case study, it helps me to utilise various tools like Talend Data Integration,
Talend Data Preparation, and SAS Enterprise Miner in streamlining my workflow. With the aids from
Talend Data Integration and Talend Data Preparation, those tools allow me to conduct basic data cleaning and
preprocessing without compromising the data quality. In addition, the user-interface of those tools are
user-friendly and easy to navigate too. In terms of SAS Enterprise Miner, it is a powerhouse comprises of various
utilities and tools which allow a data scientist or data analyst to conduct data preprocessing, data analysis, data modelling,
model performance evaluation, etc in one single platform. Therefore, it saves the hassle for them to keep on switching tools
or platforms to perform certain tasks.

The main challenges faced while conducting this cae study are as below:-
- The initial learning curve for all those tools. As those tools required you to follow a systematic
workflow and configurations, so that you could fully utilise the tools and obtain the wanted results.
- The selection and pre-processing of datasets. As the dataset used for any data analysis and modeling, it needs to be realistic and representative
of actual e-commerce customer behaviour to achieve meaningful analysis and real-world applicability. Therefore, careful selection
and data preprocessing is required to create the dataset that is suitabe for this alternative assessment.
- Data imbalance issues

To overcome those challenges, the following steps can be taken:-
- To prepare and read the ebook guidance and check on the tool's community to seek for the solutions to your problems.
- To select a dataset that is very identical to the dataset criteria set in the AA1, and perform additional data transformation and manipulation
for it to be a realistic and representative of actual e-commerce customer behaviour data.
- To employ data balancing technique like oversampling or undersampling to treat the imbalance dataset.
