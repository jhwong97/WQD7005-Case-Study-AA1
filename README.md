# WQD7005-Case-Study-AA1

## Project Overview
In this case study, a dataset related to e-commerce customer behaviour is collected. The dataset 
will be used to train models like decision tree, boosting and bagging model in predicting the 
customer churn. To accomplish this, a toolkit comprising Talend Data Integration, Talend Data 
Preparation, and SAS Enterprise Miner has been strategically selected. These tools, renowned 
for their proficiency in handling diverse datasets and facilitating advanced analytics, provide 
the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of E-commerce customer dynamics. The
details of the work are explained in this report

## Objectives
- To obtain or create a dataset which satisfies or closely matches the Alternative 
Assessment 1 criteria and related to E-commerce customers behaviour analysis.
- To utilise existing tools like Talend Data Integration, Talend Data Preparation and 
SAS Enterprise Miner to perform data integration, data preprocessing, data analysis 
and modelling on the collected dataset.
- To create decision tree, bagging and boosting model to predict the customer churn and 
evaluate their model performance via SAS Enterprise Miner.
- To discuss the potential strategies to enhance the performance of the selected models.
- To suggest potential business strategy for customer retention

## Tools Used
### Talend Data Integration
- It is used to integrate two different sets of datasets into one unified data
### Talend Data Preparation
- It is used to perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing like fixing invalid values,
standardizing data formats, etc.
### SAS Enterprise Miner
- It is used to perform data preprocessing in handling missing values, correlation analysis,
data partitioning, and data modelling for Decision Tree, Bagging and Boosting
